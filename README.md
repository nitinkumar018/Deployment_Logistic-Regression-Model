# LOGISTIC REGRESSION
## Data Exploration, Data Preprocessing
## Model Building, Model Evaluation
## Interpret the coefficients of the logistic regression model
## significance of features in predicting the target variable (survival probability in this case)

# Deployment with Streamlit
## In this task, we will deploy our logistic regression model using Streamlit. The deployment can be done locally or online via Streamlit Share. Our task includes creating a Streamlit app in Python that involves loading your trained model and setting up user inputs for predictions.
